## Database Initialization

The project uses H2 in-memory database for data persistence. Initial data is provided at start-up for testing purposes through DataLoader class in config folder.
This setup ensures that the database is populated with books every time the project reloads or is initialized. Data can be found in resources folder.

## Swagger Documentation

Swagger UI is available to interact with the API and  view documentation. Access point: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/`.
